The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an interface user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the user.
