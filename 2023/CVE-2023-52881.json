    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\nThe ACK value is considered acceptable only if\nit is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=\nSND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\nabove condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\nbe noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\nduplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.
