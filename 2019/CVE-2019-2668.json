Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.1 - 12.1.3 and 12.2.3 - 12.2.8. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment accessible data.
