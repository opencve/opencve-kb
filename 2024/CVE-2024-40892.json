    "description": "A weak credential vulnerability exists in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. This vulnerability allows a physically close attacker to use the license UUID for authentication and provision SSH credentials over the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface. Once an attacker gains access to the LAN, they could log into the SSH interface using the provisioned credentials. The license UUID can be acquired through plain-text Bluetooth sniffing, reading the QR code on the bottom of the device, or brute-forcing the UUID (though this is less likely).",
