    "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Manager product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component: View Reports). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.3 and 12.2.3-12.2.10. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Applications Manager. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Applications Manager, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Applications Manager accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Applications Manager accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Applications Manager.
