Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTPS to compromise Oracle iSupport. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle iSupport, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle iSupport accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle iSupport accessible data.
