For an attacker to exploit this Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, it's necessary for the affected product to expose the Offline Help Pages. An attacker may gain access to sensitive information or execute client-side code in the browser session of the victim user. Furthermore, an attacker would require the victim to open a malicious link. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability in order to perform phishing attacks.
