Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with access to the physical communication segment attached to the hardware where the Hyperion Analytic Provider Services executes to compromise Hyperion Analytic Provider Services. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Hyperion Analytic Provider Services accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Hyperion Analytic Provider Services accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Hyperion Analytic Provider Services.
