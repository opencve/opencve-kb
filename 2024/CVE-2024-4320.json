    "description": "A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the '/install_extension' endpoint of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `@router.post(\"/install_extension\")` route handler. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of the `name` parameter in the `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()` method, which allows for local file inclusion (LFI) leading to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `name` parameter that causes the server to load and execute a `__init__.py` file from an arbitrary location, such as the upload directory for discussions. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to remote code execution without requiring user interaction, especially when the application is exposed to an external endpoint or operated in headless mode.",
