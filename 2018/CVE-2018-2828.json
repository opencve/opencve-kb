Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.1.9.0, 12.2.1.2.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebCenter Content. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle WebCenter Content, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebCenter Content accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle WebCenter Content accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle WebCenter Content.
