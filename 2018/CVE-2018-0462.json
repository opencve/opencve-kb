The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-provided input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with a highly privileged user account and performing a sequence of specific user management operations that interfere with the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to permanently degrade the functionality of the affected system.",
