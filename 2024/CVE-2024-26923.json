This\nmakes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After\nflipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if\nthere is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At\nthis point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already\ntaken.
