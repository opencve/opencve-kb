Supported versions that are affected are 6.5.11, 7.0.6, 7.1.6, 15.0.1 and 16.0.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service.
