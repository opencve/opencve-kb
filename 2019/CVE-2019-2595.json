Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.1.9.0, 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher). Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data.
