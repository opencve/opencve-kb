    "description": "An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server. \n\nImportant: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which typically restricts local login access to Administrators only.
