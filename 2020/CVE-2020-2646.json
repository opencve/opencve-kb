Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.5, 13.2.0.0 and 13.3.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Enterprise Manager Base Platform. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Enterprise Manager Base Platform, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data.
