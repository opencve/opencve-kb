The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if the attacker tricks a legitimate user to open a manipulated project. In order to exploit the vulnerability, a valid user must open a manipulated project file. No further privileges are required on the target system. The vulnerability could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the engineering station.
