Releases prior to v2022-03-01 are subject to a denial of service attack via a crafted object causing a hash collision.

The issue has been fixed in wire-server 2022-03-01 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-03-01, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
