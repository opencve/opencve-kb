    "description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.",
