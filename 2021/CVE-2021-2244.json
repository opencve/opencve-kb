    "description": "Vulnerability in the Hyperion Analytic Provider Services product of Oracle Hyperion (component: JAPI) and Essbase Analytic Provider Services product of Oracle Essbase (component: JAPI). Supported versions that are affected are Hyperion Analytic Provider Services 11.1.2.4 and 12.2.1.4, and Essbase Analytic Provider Services 21.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Hyperion Analytic Provider Services. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Hyperion Analytic Provider Services, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Hyperion Analytic Provider Services. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 10.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).
