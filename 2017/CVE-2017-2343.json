    "description": "The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of \"Status: Connected\" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series. Devices on any version of Junos OS 12.1X46, or 12.1X47 are unaffected by this issue.",
