Supported versions that are affected are 11.5.10, 12.1 and 12.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data.
