Attacking locally is a requirement. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as 3332c5ba9ec3014ddc74e2147190a050eee97bc0. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-221478 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.",
