The affected device contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to restore the affected device to a point where predefined application and operating system protection mechanisms are not in place. Successful exploitation requires physical access to the system, but no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentialiy, integrity and availability of the device.
