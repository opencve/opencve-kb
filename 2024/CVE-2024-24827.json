Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process.

The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade.
