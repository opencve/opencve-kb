There is a persistent XSS vulnerability in the file-upload functionality for uploading icons when attempting to create new Apps. An attacker with minimal privileges in the application can build their own App and upload a malicious file containing an XSS payload, by uploading an arbitrary file and modifying the MIME type in a subsequent HTTP request. This then allows the file to be stored and retrieved from the server by other users in the same organization.",
