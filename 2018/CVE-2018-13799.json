Improper access control to a data point of the affected product could allow an unauthenticated remote user to escalate its privileges in the context of SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to port 5678/TCP of the SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14 server. Successful exploitation requires no user privileges and no user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise integrity and availability of the SIMATIC WinCC OA system.
