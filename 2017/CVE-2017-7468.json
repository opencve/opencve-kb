That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous certificate (or no certificate). libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes.
