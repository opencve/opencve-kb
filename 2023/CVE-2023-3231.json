The manipulation of the argument dir leads to information disclosure. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 7.0.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.
