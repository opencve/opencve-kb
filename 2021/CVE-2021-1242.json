The vulnerability exists because the affected software mishandles character rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sharing a file within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify how the shared file name displays within the interface, which could allow the attacker to conduct phishing or spoofing attacks.",
