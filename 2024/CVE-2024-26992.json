    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBS\n\nDrop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation is\narchitecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and because\nexposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leak\nhost kernel addresses to the guest.\n\nBug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits of\nIA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.g\nfixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()\nstores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.\n\nBug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero value\nfor PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even if\nthe guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptive\nPEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to the\nguest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,\ni.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.\n\nBug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upper\nbits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, and\nintel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE\neither.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of what\nKVM requests.\n\nBug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters set\nby the host, as \"Updated Memory Access Info Group\" records information\nthat might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.\n\nBug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at least\nzeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guest\nto read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling \"LBR Entries\"\nrecords.\n\nDisable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity of\nthe LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will be\nnon-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.\n\nNote!
