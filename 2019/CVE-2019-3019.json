Supported versions that are affected are 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 and 19.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Banking Digital Experience. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Banking Digital Experience, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Banking Digital Experience accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Banking Digital Experience accessible data.
