Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Customer Interaction History.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Customer Interaction History, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Customer Interaction History accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Customer Interaction History accessible data.
