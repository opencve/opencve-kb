    "description": "A vulnerability in the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured user filters on the device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms for certain SPF messages that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized SPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the header filters that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious content to pass through the device.",
