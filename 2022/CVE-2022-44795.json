The command that creates the URL for the support bundle uses an insecure RNG. That can lead to prediction of the generated URL. As a result, an attacker can get access to system logs. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611. Important note - This vulnerability is related to the Object First Ootbi BETA version, which is not released for production and therefore has no impact on the production environment. The production-ready Object First Ootbi version will have this vulnerability fixed.",
