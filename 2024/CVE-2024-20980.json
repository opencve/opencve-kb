Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle BI Publisher.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle BI Publisher, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle BI Publisher accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle BI Publisher accessible data.
