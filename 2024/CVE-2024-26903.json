In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a\n`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet\n(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of\nencryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately\nreplies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the\nEncryption Key Size.\n\n2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this\npacket was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP\nlayers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.\n\n3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described\nin point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.\nHowever, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`\nhad already been released, and when the function executed\n`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,\nspecifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.\n\nTo fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling\nrfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.",
