In a KVM based CloudStack environment, an attacker can exploit this issue to attach host devices such as storage disks, and PCI and USB devices such as network adapters and GPUs, in a regular VM instance that can be further exploited to gain access to the underlying network and storage infrastructure resources, and access any VM instance disks on the local storage.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to version 4.18.1.1 or 4.19.0.1, which fixes this issue.\n\n",
