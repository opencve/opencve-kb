We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1 and 2.9.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. However, we will not cherrypick this commit into TensorFlow 2.8.x, as it depends on Eigen behavior that changed between 2.8 and 2.9.",
