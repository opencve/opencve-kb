Supported versions that are affected are 11.5.0, 11.6.0 and 11.7.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle FLEXCUBE Core Banking. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle FLEXCUBE Core Banking, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle FLEXCUBE Core Banking accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle FLEXCUBE Core Banking accessible data.
