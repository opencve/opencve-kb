    "description": "Security researchers discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in version 2.0.2 of the Conserus Workflow Intelligence application by McKesson Medical Imaging Company, which is now a Change Healthcare company. The attacker must send a malicious HTTP GET request to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and escalate privileges of valid users. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability and be granted limited access to other accounts. An authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability and be granted access reserved for higher privilege users.",
