This vulnerability arises from inadequate filtering of responses returned from the external interface. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by hijacking the ISP or an upper-layer router to gain privileges on the Xiaomi router. Successful exploitation of this flaw could permit remote code execution and complete compromise of the device.",
