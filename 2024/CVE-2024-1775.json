NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g., administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain social engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation). However, successful exploitation requires \"Debug mode\" to be enabled in the plugin's \"Global Settings\".",
