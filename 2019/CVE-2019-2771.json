Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher).
