Affected is the function cgi_move_photo of the file /cgi-bin/photocenter_mgr.cgi. The manipulation of the argument photo_name leads to buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",
