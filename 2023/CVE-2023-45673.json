A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted note to execute arbitrary shell commands. Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code execution because Joplin desktop: 1. has not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes, and 2. and has node integration enabled. This is a remote code execution vulnerability that impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled. This issue has been addressed in version 2.13.3.
