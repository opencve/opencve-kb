    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove\n\nIn commit ac5047671758 (\"hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the\nVMBus channel\"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,\nincluding all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.\n\nThis caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()\nhas finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.\nnetvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the\nsub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.\nnetvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which\nnetvsc_subchan_work did not run.\n\nnetif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI\ncannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the\nNAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the\nopposite.\n\nNow during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those\nsubchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.\n\nThis fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not\ngetting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.\nBut netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct\nfor cleanup purpose.\n\nCall trace:\n[  654.559417] task:modprobe        state:D stack:    0 pid: 2321 ppid:  1091 flags:0x00004002\n[  654.568030] Call Trace:\n[  654.571221]  <TASK>\n[  654.573790]  __schedule+0x2d6/0x960\n[  654.577733]  schedule+0x69/0xf0\n[  654.581214]  schedule_timeout+0x87/0x140\n[  654.585463]  ? __bpf_trace_tick_stop+0x20/0x20\n[  654.590291]  msleep+0x2d/0x40\n[  654.593625]  napi_disable+0x2b/0x80\n[  654.597437]  netvsc_device_remove+0x8a/0x1f0 [hv_netvsc]\n[  654.603935]  rndis_filter_device_remove+0x194/0x1c0 [hv_netvsc]\n[  654.611101]  ? do_wait_intr+0xb0/0xb0\n[  654.615753]  netvsc_remove+0x7c/0x120 [hv_netvsc]\n[  654.621675]  vmbus_remove+0x27/0x40 [hv_vmbus]",
