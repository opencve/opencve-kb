Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise BI Publisher.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in BI Publisher, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of BI Publisher accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of BI Publisher accessible data.
