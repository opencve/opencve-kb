The vulnerability is present due to the kernel driver failing to allocate sufficient memory on the kernel heap to contain a user supplied string as such the string is copied into a buffer of constant size (0x1000-bytes) and thus an overflow condition results. Access to the kernel driver is permitted through an obfuscated interface whereby bytes of user supplied message are \"authenticated\" via an obfuscation routine employing a linear equation.",
