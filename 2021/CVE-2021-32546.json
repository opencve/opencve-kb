An unprivileged attacker (registered user) can overwrite the Git configuration in his repository.

The remote branch can also be configured by editing the Git configuration file. One can create a new file in a new repository, using the GUI, with \"\\\" as its name, and then rename this file to .git/config with the custom configuration content (and then save it).",
