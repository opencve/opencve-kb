    "description": "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow, specifically in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks.",
