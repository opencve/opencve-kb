The vulnerability allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage, which can then trigger arbitrary LoLLMS-XTTS API requests. This issue can lead to the reading and writing of audio files and, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could allow for the reading of arbitrary files on the system and writing files outside the permitted audio file location.",
