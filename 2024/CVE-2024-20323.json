    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Intelligent Node (iNode) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack the TLS connection between Cisco iNode Manager and associated intelligent nodes and send arbitrary traffic to an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the presence of hard-coded cryptographic material. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco iNode Manager and associated deployed nodes could exploit this vulnerability by using the static cryptographic key to generate a trusted certificate and impersonate an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read data that is meant for a legitimate device, modify the startup configuration of an associated node, and, consequently, cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for downstream devices that are connected to the affected node.",
