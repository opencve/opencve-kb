Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.1, 12.1.2 and 12.1.3. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Customer Interaction History. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Customer Interaction History, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Customer Interaction History accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Customer Interaction History accessible data.
