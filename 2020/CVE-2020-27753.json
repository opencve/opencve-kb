These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to application availability or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported that the issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is where LeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF coder, which incorrectly handles data being passed to `AcquireMagickMemory()`.
