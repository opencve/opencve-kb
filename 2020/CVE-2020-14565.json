Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.2.3.0, 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Unified Directory. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Unified Directory, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Unified Directory accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Unified Directory.
