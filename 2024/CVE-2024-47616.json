Improper access to the databroker API could allow exfiltration of user info, spoofing of user sessions, or tampering with Pomerium routes, policies, and other settings. A Pomerium deployment is susceptible to this issue if all of the following conditions are met, you have issued a service account access token using Pomerium Zero or Pomerium Enterprise, the access token has an explicit expiration date in the future, and the core Pomerium databroker gRPC API is not otherwise secured by network access controls.
