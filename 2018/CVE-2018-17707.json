User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handler for the com.epicgames.launcher protocol. A crafted URI with the com.epicgames.launcher protocol can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string.
