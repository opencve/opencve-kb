    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials.",
