Specially crafted network packets sent to port 80/tcp or 443/tcp could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the device. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems on port 80/tcp or 443/tcp. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the device.
