    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem\n\nsyzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes\nelements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be\ninvoked from any interrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elem\noperation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion\nis possible, as reported by lockdep:\n\n       CPU0                    CPU1\n       ----                    ----\n  lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);\n                               local_irq_disable();\n                               lock(&host->lock);\n                               lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);\n  <Interrupt>\n    lock(&host->lock);\n\nLocks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be\ndeleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts\nenabled, or in softirq context.\n\nDetect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is\n_not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with an\nerror.\n\nNote that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not\nallow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.",
