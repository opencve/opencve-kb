The CVE-2020-14300 was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the docker packages produced by Red Hat. The original issue - CVE-2016-9962 - could possibly allow a process inside container to compromise a process entering container namespace and execute arbitrary code outside of the container. This could lead to compromise of the container host or other containers running on the same container host.
