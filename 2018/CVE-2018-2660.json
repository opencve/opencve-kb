Supported versions that are affected are 7.3.5.x and 8.0.x. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications Infrastructure. While the vulnerability is in Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications Infrastructure, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications Infrastructure accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications Infrastructure accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications Infrastructure.
