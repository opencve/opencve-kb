Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope.

The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.
