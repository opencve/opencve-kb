Supported versions that are affected are 12.3.0, 12.4.0, 12.5.0, 14.0.0 and 14.1.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Banking Corporate Lending. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Banking Corporate Lending, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Banking Corporate Lending accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Banking Corporate Lending accessible data.
