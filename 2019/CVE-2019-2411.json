Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System accessible data.
