Supported versions that are affected are 5.4.0.x, 5.4.1.x, 5.4.2.x, 5.4.3.x, 5.5.0.x and 5.5.1.x. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5 Property Services. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5 Property Services, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5 Property Services accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5 Property Services accessible data.
