Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.3, 12.2.3, 12.2.4, 12.2.5 and 12.2.6. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle One-to-One Fulfillment, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
