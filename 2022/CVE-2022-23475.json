Users may also mitigate this issue with in two parts 1) The CSRF vulnerability can be mitigated  by making the daloRadius session cookie to samesite=Lax or by the implimentation of a CSRF token in all forms. 2) The XSS vulnerability may be mitigated by escaping it or by introducing a Content-Security policy.\n\n\n",
