An authenticated attacker with a high-privileged user account access via SSH could circumvent restrictions in place and execute arbitrary operating system commands. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the SSH interface in on port 22/tcp. The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
