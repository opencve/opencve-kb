By manipulating the ChatBot responses, an attacker can inject malicious scripts to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating a new admin account or changing the user's password, leading to a complete takeover of the AnythingLLM application. The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user and ChatBot input, specifically through the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
