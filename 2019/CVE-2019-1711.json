The vulnerability is due to improper handling of gRPC requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending unauthenticated gRPC requests to the affected device. A successful exploit could cause the emsd process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. Resolved in Cisco IOS XR 6.5.1 and later.",
