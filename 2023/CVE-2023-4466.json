Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component Web Interface. The manipulation leads to protection mechanism failure. The attack can be launched remotely. The vendor explains that they do not regard this as a vulnerability as this is a feature that they offer to their customers who have a variety of environmental needs that are met through different firmware builds. To avoid potential roll-back attacks, they remove vulnerable builds from the public servers as a remediation effort. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
