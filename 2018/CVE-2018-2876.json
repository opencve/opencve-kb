    "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Retail Integration Bus component of Oracle Retail Applications (subcomponent: RIB Kernal(Apache Commons Collections)). The supported version that is affected is 13.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Retail Integration Bus. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Retail Integration Bus, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Retail Integration Bus accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Retail Integration Bus accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Retail Integration Bus.
