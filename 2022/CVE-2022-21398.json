Supported versions that are affected are 3.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Communications Operations Monitor. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Communications Operations Monitor, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Communications Operations Monitor accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Communications Operations Monitor accessible data.
