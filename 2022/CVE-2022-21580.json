Supported versions that are affected are 2.9.0.0.0, 2.9.0.1.0, 3.0.0.0.0-3.2.0.0.0 and 4.0.0.0.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing.
