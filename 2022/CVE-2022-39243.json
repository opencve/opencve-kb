In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.",
