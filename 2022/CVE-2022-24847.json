The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution.

In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API.

Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.",
