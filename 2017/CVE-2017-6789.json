The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied data in the DOM input is not validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious DOM statements to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to affect the integrity of the system by manipulating the database. Known Affected Releases 11.0(1)ES10. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf18325.",
