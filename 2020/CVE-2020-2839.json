Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.1-12.1.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Service Intelligence. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Service Intelligence, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Service Intelligence accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Service Intelligence accessible data.
