NOTE: this issue is not always security related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default configuration in those versions.",
