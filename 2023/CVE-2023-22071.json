    "description": "Vulnerability in the PL/SQL component of Oracle Database Server.  Supported versions that are affected are 19.3-19.20 and  21.3-21.11. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker having Create Session, Execute on sys.utl_http privilege with network access via Oracle Net to compromise PL/SQL.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in PL/SQL, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of PL/SQL accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of PL/SQL accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of PL/SQL.
