In the wire-webapp, certain combinations of Markdown formatting can trigger an unhandled error in the conversion to HTML representation. The error makes it impossible to display the affected chat history, other conversations are not affected. The issue has been fixed in version 2022-11-02 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-11-02-production.0-v0.31.9-0-337e400 or wire-server 2022-11-03 (chart/4.26.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. As a workaround, you may use an iOS or Android client and delete the corresponding message from the history OR write 30 or more messages into the affected conversation to prevent the client from further rendering of the corresponding message. When attempting to retrieve messages from the conversation history, the error will continue to occur once the malformed message is part of the result.",
