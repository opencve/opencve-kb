Affected is an unknown function of the file usertable.htm?action=delete of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument username leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 4.30 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-250692. NOTE: The vendor explains that this is a very old issue that got fixed 20 years ago but without a public disclosure.",
