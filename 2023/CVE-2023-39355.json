Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x release branch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context->maxPlaneSize` is 0, `context->planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating `context->planesBuffer`, this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector.
