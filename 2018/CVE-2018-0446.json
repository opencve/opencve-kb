The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious, customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.",
