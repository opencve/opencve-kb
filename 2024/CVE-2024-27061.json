    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unprepare\n\nsun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare should be called before\ncrypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacks may\nimmediately free memory, that isn't needed anymore. But it will be\nused by unprepare after free. Before removing prepare/unprepare\ncallbacks it was handled by crypto engine in crypto_finalize_request.\n\nUsually that results in a pointer dereference problem during a in\ncrypto selftest.\n Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\n                                      virtual address 0000000000000030\n Mem abort info:\n   ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n Data abort info:\n   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000004716d000\n [0000000000000030] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000\n Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] SMP\n\nThis problem is detected by KASAN as well.\n ==================================================================\n BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in sun8i_ce_cipher_do_one+0x6e8/0xf80 [sun8i_ce]\n Read of size 8 at addr ffff00000dcdc040 by task 1c15000.crypto-/373\n\n Hardware name: Pine64 PinePhone (1.2) (DT)\n Call trace:\n  dump_backtrace+0x9c/0x128\n  show_stack+0x20/0x38\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x48/0x60\n  print_report+0xf8/0x5d8\n  kasan_report+0x90/0xd0\n  __asan_load8+0x9c/0xc0\n  sun8i_ce_cipher_do_one+0x6e8/0xf80 [sun8i_ce]\n  crypto_pump_work+0x354/0x620 [crypto_engine]\n  kthread_worker_fn+0x244/0x498\n  kthread+0x168/0x178\n  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\n Allocated by task 379:\n  kasan_save_stack+0x3c/0x68\n  kasan_set_track+0x2c/0x40\n  kasan_save_alloc_info+0x24/0x38\n  __kasan_kmalloc+0xd4/0xd8\n  __kmalloc+0x74/0x1d0\n  alg_test_skcipher+0x90/0x1f0\n  alg_test+0x24c/0x830\n  cryptomgr_test+0x38/0x60\n  kthread+0x168/0x178\n  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\n Freed by task 379:\n  kasan_save_stack+0x3c/0x68\n  kasan_set_track+0x2c/0x40\n  kasan_save_free_info+0x38/0x60\n  __kasan_slab_free+0x100/0x170\n  slab_free_freelist_hook+0xd4/0x1e8\n  __kmem_cache_free+0x15c/0x290\n  kfree+0x74/0x100\n  kfree_sensitive+0x80/0xb0\n  alg_test_skcipher+0x12c/0x1f0\n  alg_test+0x24c/0x830\n  cryptomgr_test+0x38/0x60\n  kthread+0x168/0x178\n  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\n The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff00000dcdc000\n  which belongs to the cache kmalloc-256 of size 256\n The buggy address is located 64 bytes inside of\n  freed 256-byte region [ffff00000dcdc000, ffff00000dcdc100)",
