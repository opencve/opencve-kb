    "description": "An SSRF vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs in the `/proxy` route. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `self.replica_urls` set through the `X-Direct-Url` header in requests to the `/` and `/config` routes, allowing the addition of arbitrary URLs for proxying. This flaw enables unauthorized proxying of requests and potential access to internal endpoints within the Hugging Face space.
