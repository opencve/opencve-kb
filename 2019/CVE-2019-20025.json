    "description": "Certain builds of NEC SV9100 software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log into a device running an affected release with a hardcoded username and password, aka a Static Credential Vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to an undocumented user account with manufacturer privilege level. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this account to remotely log into an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log into the device with manufacturer level access. This vulnerability affects SV9100 PBXes that are running software release 6.0 or higher. This vulnerability does not affect SV9100 software releases prior to 6.0.",
