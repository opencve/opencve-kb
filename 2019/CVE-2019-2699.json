    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Windows DLL). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u202. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. While the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.
