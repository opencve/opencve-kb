Supported versions that are affected are 12.0.2 and 12.0.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle FLEXCUBE Direct Banking. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle FLEXCUBE Direct Banking as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle FLEXCUBE Direct Banking accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle FLEXCUBE Direct Banking accessible data.
