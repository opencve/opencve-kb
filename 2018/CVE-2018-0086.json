The vulnerability is due to malformed SIP INVITE traffic received on the CVP during communications with the Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser (VVB). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP INVITE traffic to the targeted appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability of services and data on the device, causing a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified CVP running any software release prior to 11.6(1). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve85840.",
