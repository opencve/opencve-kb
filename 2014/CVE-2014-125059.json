Upgrading to version 0.1.0 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is cf715d911d8ce17969a7926dea651e930c27e71a. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-217613 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: This case is rather theoretical and probably won't happen. Maybe only on obscure Web servers.",
